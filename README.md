# Psychedelic Sound & Pattern Generator
This script generates vibrant, changing ASCII patterns and sounds in the console for a groovy experience.

## Description
This script generates a colorful, dynamic pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces in the console. The width of the pattern is initially set to 40 characters but can be adjusted by the user. Every time an asterisk is printed, a beep sound is played. The frequency of the beep changes based on the current row of the pattern.

The pattern and sounds together create a unique and captivating audiovisual experience. The colors of the asterisks cycle through the rainbow, adding to the psychedelic effect.

## How to Use
1. Compile the script using a C++ compiler that supports the windows.h library (for example, GCC for Windows).
2. Run the compiled program.
3. While the program is running, you can:
	4. Increase the width of the pattern by pressing the '+' key.
	5. Decrease it by pressing the '-' key.
	6. Change the shape of the pattern by pressing the 's' key.
7. The pattern will update in real-time, and the sounds will change to match.

## Note
Please be mindful of the volume level when running the program, as the beep sounds may be loud depending on your system settings. Enjoy the psychedelic experience!
